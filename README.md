# Bike-sharing

## Overview
The purpose of this analysis is to determine whether the bike-sharing program in DesMoines is a solid business proposal. The data was cleaned by using Python and Pandas and visualized by using Tableau. I used the data from Citi Bike in New York City in August 2019 as a reference to see the usage of bike-sharing. ([201908-citibike-tripdata](https://s3.amazonaws.com/tripdata/index.html))

To solidify the proposal, the bike trip analysis would include:
- The distribution of biking hours in August.
- The top locations that riders prefer to start their bike trips.
- The length of time that bikes are checked out for all riders and genders.
- The number of bike trips for all riders and genders for each hour of each day of the week.
- The number of bike trips for each type of user and gender for each day of the week.

## Summary
From the data, we know that users prefer to utilize bike-sharing during rush hours of workdays. The most popular time for bike-sharing of the week is from 5 pm to 7 pm on Thursday. In addition, most users utilize bike-sharing for 5 minutes, which means that most users like to use shared bicycles when travelling short distances. Compared with female users, male users trip more with bike-sharing.

To properly determine whether bike-sharing would be profitable in Des Moines, further analyses are needed:
- We need to collect more weather data from Des Moines to see if bike-sharing are suitable for local weather conditions.
- The population and transportation of the two cities are different. We need to dig into the local data in Des Moines to better analyze whether bike-sharing would be profitable for Des Moines.
