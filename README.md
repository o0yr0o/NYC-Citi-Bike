# Bikesharing

## Overview
The purpose of this analysis is to determine whether the bike-sharing program in DesMoines is a solid business proposal. The data was cleaned by using Python and Pandas and visualized by using Tableau. The data I used is from the New York City Citi Bike data in August 2019. ([201908-citibike-tripdata](https://s3.amazonaws.com/tripdata/index.html))

To solidify the proposal, the bike trip analysis would include:
- The distribution of biking hours in August.
- The top locations that riders prefer to start their bike trips.
- The length of time that bikes are checked out for all riders and genders.
- The number of bike trips for all riders and genders for each hour of each day of the week.
- The number of bike trips for each type of user and gender for each day of the week.
